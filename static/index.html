    <h1>Hey, It's Me! (.xyz)</h1>

    <p>heyitsme.xyz provides the simplest interface possible for you to create a landing page for yourself.</p>

    <p>first, send a get request to a url you want to claim. it'll return a freshly generated secret code.</p>

    <pre>
      curl https://heyitsme.xyz/YOUR_URL</pre>

    <p>
      that'll return a response like 
    </p>

    <pre>
      secret code: YOUR_SECRET_CODE</pre>

    <p>
      make sure you save your secret code! it's the only way you'll be able to update your page.
    </p> 

    <p>
      then, you can go ahead and update your page using the following curl command. you may have up to 5 links, but only 2 are listed for the sake of conciseness.
    </p>

    <p>
      <pre>
        curl -d '{
          "secret":"YOUR SECRET CODE",
          "name":"YOUR NAME",
          "pronouns":"YOUR PRONOUNS",
          "bio":"YOUR BIOGRAPHY",
          "link1text":"YOUR FIRST LINK",
          "link1href":"YOUR FIRST LINK ADDRESS",
          "link2text":"YOUR SECOND LINK",
          "link2href":"YOUR SECOND LINK ADDRESS"
        }' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST http://heyitsme.xyz/YOUR_URL
